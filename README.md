#Introduction
To maintain ecosystems and economies in good shape and to ensure human health and welfare, water, and sanitation are necessary. To have access to adequate and secure water and sanitation services, nevertheless, is a major difficulty in many parts of the world. Supporting and increasing engagement in a variety of water and sanitation-related technologies and strategies, such as water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, and recycling and reuse technologies, is crucial to addressing these concerns. </p>
#Scope
When we talked about the system process, we divided our main system into four core services: Purification &amp; Operation, Education &amp; Discussion, Donations &amp; Supporting, and Promoting &amp; Encourage Innovate Products. Each core service has a charge admin and there is one general admin as well.

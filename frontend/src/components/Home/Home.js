              Wastewater treatment is the process of removing contaminants from
              wastewater to make it safe for discharge into the environment or
              reuse. Water quality monitoring is the practice of testing and
              analyzing water samples to assess their quality and ensure that
              they meet certain standards for human consumption, recreational
              use, or environmental protection. Regular water quality monitoring
              is important for ensuring that water resources are safe for humans
              and aquatic life, and for identifying and addressing potential
              pollution sources.
